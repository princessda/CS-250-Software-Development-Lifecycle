# CS-250-Software-Development-Lifecycle
For the final project of this class, I added this deliverable of a Sprint Review and Retrospective. This deliverable pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices that you have applied throughout my CS 250 Software & Developement Lifecycle course.

How did I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs effectively, it’s essential to engage with stakeholders and potential users through interviews, surveys, or usability testing. This interaction helps uncover their pain points and expectations. Once you gather this information, you can translate it into actionable tasks. Creating “user stories” is a pivotal part of this process. User stories frame requirements from the user's perspective, focusing on their goals. For example, a user story for a travel booking system might be: “As a traveler, I want to book a flight quickly so that I can finalize my travel plans.” This format clarifies what features are necessary and why, guiding the development team on priorities and ensuring that the final product meets real user needs. Breaking these user stories down into smaller tasks enables a structured approach to implementation, making it easier to track progress and adapt as feedback is received.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is iterative and collaborative. I prioritize understanding user needs through research and feedback, ensuring that each iteration of the product is aligned with user expectations. Utilizing Agile processes such as Scrum helps facilitate this approach by promoting regular communication, adaptability, and transparency.
In future development work, I aim to incorporate the following Agile processes:
Frequent iterations: Developing in short cycles allows for continuous improvement based on user feedback.
Regular ceremonies: Engaging in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives ensures alignment within the team and fosters a culture of openness.
Emphasizing collaboration: Working closely with cross-functional team members and stakeholders to enhance problem-solving and creativity

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To me, being a good team member in software development involves several key qualities,
Communication: Openly sharing progress, challenges, and ideas fosters a collaborative environment. Active listening is just as crucial, allowing team members to understand each other’s perspectives.
Accountability: Taking ownership of tasks and delivering on commitments builds trust within the team.
Adaptability: Being flexible to change and willing to incorporate feedback can significantly improve the project’s outcome.
Supportiveness: Helping teammates overcome challenges and celebrating collective achievements enhances team cohesion and morale.
